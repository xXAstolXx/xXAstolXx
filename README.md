# About Me 
Since my time in elementary school, games have fascinated me and helped me through a difficult period. As a result, I have been drawn to Gaming and my dream has always been to become a game maker. However, I eventually abandoned that dream and pursued other interests. Nevertheless, my love for games persisted, and I redirected my focus towards becoming a game developer. Prior to attending the School for Games, I gained experience in programming by creating a little game called Star Rush, which I thoroughly enjoyed. As a result, after completing high school, I decided to pursue a career as a game programmer and make my dream a reality. And so, here we are.
